follow your files to get into your otg saved game files and use notepad++ or vs code and copy and paste the settings. C:\Users\dylan\Saved Games\OTG
if the copy paste dosent work highlight your entire save file and put it into chat gpt and ask it for a fps boost.
once you change the values you cannot go in game and adjust settings without it reseting to game defaults.
i began at 70 fps and no have 120+
